Moss Introduces Jenn to the Internet | IT Crowd [3 minutes]

Funny, obviously a ridiculous joke. We could talk about what the internet

network that transmits the data, the servers that route requests through
said network.)

(The following clip is funny also. [3 minutes])

Rubik's Cube Solver [2 minutes]

Emphasize that the computers can find the solution pretty quickly, it's the
physical manipulation of the cube that makes it hard. Not sure if this one
computes the solution on its own, but there are systems that take pictures of
the cube and compute the solution for themselves. Using algorithms we can
make machines do smart looking stuff.
