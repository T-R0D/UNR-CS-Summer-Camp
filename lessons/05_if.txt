Learning
--------
Sometimes we want our programs to be able to adapt their behavior and do
different things based on the situation. That's where 'if' comes in. With
'if' we can tall our program to execute more code if a condition evaluates to
'true'.

Example:
'''
#define SMALLEST_BIG_NUMBER 10

int g_number = 0;

void setup() {
	Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
	Serial.println(g_number);

	if (g_number > SMALLEST_BIG_NUMBER) {
		Serial.println("g_number is getting kind of big...");
	}

	g_number += 1;
}
'''

In 'if' statements we can use the following logical operators to combine
statements:
~~~

==    Equals. Results in true if both sides are the same, false otherwise.
	  Ex: '4 == 4' is true, but '4 == 0' is false.

!=    Not Equals. The opposite of equals.
	  Ex: '4 != 0' is true; '4 != 4' is false.

<     Less Than. Ex: '4 < 5' is true; '4 < 4' is false.
      There is also Greater Than ('>').

<=    Less Than or Equal. Ex: '4 <= 4' is true; '4 <= 3' is false.
      There is also Greater Than or Equal ('>=').

&&    Logical And. True only if both sides are true.
	  Ex: 'true && true' is true; 'true && false' is false.

||    Logical OR. If either side is true, then the whole thing is true.
	  Ex: 'true || false' is true; 'false || false' is false.

Challenges
----------
1) Write a short program that shrieks if the value of a variable is too small.

2) Write a program that shrieks if the value of a variable is too small or too
   large.

3) Write a program that greets a person only if their name is "Bob".

*) Write a program that says that a number is "good" if the number is between
   2 and 6, that the number is bad if it is between 12 and 14, and says nothing
   otherwise.
