Learning
--------
Sometimes, we want our program to make a choice between several actions. We can
accomplish this with an "else if". "else if" works like an extra "if". You
can follow an "if" with as many "else if"s as you'd like. When you are done
adding "else if"s, you can end the chain with an "else" if you'd like. Once
the condition for any of the "if"s is met, only that code block will execute
and the rest will be skipped.

Example:
'''
/**
 * This example prints something different based on if a number is a multiple
 * of 3, 5, both, or neither.
 */

int g_number = 0;

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
    if (g_number % 3 == 0 && g_number % 5 == 0) {
        Serial.println("wubba lubba dub dub!");
    } else if (g_number % 3 == 0) {
        Serial.println("fizz");
    } else if (g_number % 5 == 0) {
        Serial.println("buzz");
    } else {
        Serial.println(".");
    }

    g_number += 1;
}

Challenges
----------
1) Write a simple program that tests a variable "grade" using an
   "if - else if - else" chain and prints out if the grade is an
   A, B, C, D, or F.

2) Write a program that says that a number is "good" if the number is between
   2 and 6, that the number is bad if it is between 12 and 14, and says nothing
   otherwise. (Yes this is a repeat, but you can do it in a better way now.)

3) Write a program that stores a number in a variable. The program should
   control 3 LEDs. The program should turn on a number of LEDs equal to the
   number held by the variable. If the number is greater than 3, just turn
   all of the LEDs on.
