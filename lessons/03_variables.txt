Learning
--------
Variables are how our programs "remember" things. Variables hold data, and then
we can use or update that data later.

Some examples:
'''
void setup() {
    // declaring some variables
    string phrase = "Hi there!";  // string variables hold text
    int sheep_counted = 2;        // int variables hold whole numbers
    float inches = 3.26;          // float variables hold fractional numbers

    // we can update variable values, or use them to make new values.
}

void loop() {
}
'''



Challenges
----------
1) Write a program that declares variables to hold your name, age, and
   temperature.

2) Modify your program to assign new values to the variables later in the
   program.

3) Modify your program to print the values of your variables at each step of
   the program.

*) Modify your program to print the variable's name and its type before
   printing its value.
