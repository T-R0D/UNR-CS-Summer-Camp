Servo Motor
===========

Description
-----------
Servo motors are motors that we can tell them what position (angle) to turn to,
and it's just that easy!


Usage Notes
-----------
Servo motors should only be told to go to positions between 0 and 180 degrees!

If your servo motor is not quit in line with the position you want,
DISCONNECT the motor, then VERY CAREFULLY turn the arms to the desired starting
position.

Servo motors work best when powered by 5+ volts.
