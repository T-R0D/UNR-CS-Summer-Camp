Potentiometer Knob
==================

Description
-----------
This is really a glorified adjustable resistor. However, we can use it as
a way for humans to give input to our project!


Usage Notes
-----------
When the twist knob is facing you, the pins from left to right are
ground, signal, and input voltage.
