Gamification
============
Earn components (like batteries) for completing various programming tasks.
    Not sure how far to take this...
    Ideas:
        - They start with a basic set like:
            Arduino and Cable
            breadboard
            resistors
            Button
            Regular LEDs
            Piezo Buzzer
            Shift Register
        - batteries
        - "advanced components" like IR, 7-segments, RGB LEDs...
        - learning to solder (not sure yet if/how this would be a good idea)
A list of Achievements (like in the video games) for completing tasks.
    Ideas:
        - make a github account/repo or bring in a flash drive
        - use a button
        - use a potentiometer
        - use temperature sensor
        - use light sensor
        - use a piezo as a noise maker
        - use a piezo as a sensor
        - use 7-segment display
        - receive IR
        - send IR
        - use LED matrix
        - use the shift register
        - bring in each component (? 'use' each component?)
Turn it into a skills tree? Could be a "Sensor" or an "Actuator", then team up for the project?
    No, bad idea, too much prep, not enough actuators, we want them to be good at everything.
Maybe a raffle - get tickets for doing cool stuff, helping others, etc.


Project Ideas
=============
Bonk it
E-Dice
Binary to Hexadecimal or Decimal via LEDs
Strength Tester
Night Light
Remote controlled anything
Happy Flower
Math Problem Alarm Clock
LED Light Show
Shuttle Run Timer
    Maybe I need to get big buttons and wire, maybe we use break-beams, maybe Arduinos shoot ir signals at each other
4-way Stop Light (bonus: add left turn signals or pressure sensitive interruption)
