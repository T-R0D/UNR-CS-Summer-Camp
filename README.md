# UNR Engineering Summer Camp: Computer Science

A summer camp for youngsters (or youngsters at heart)!

In this camp, we explore algorithmic concepts and basic electronics using Arduino starter kits. Students learn the basics through a combination of self-directed lesson modules, short lectures and demonstrations, and assistance from volunteer instructors. After working through the lessons, students design and implement a project of their own choosing with help of the instructors.

## Going Further
When campers continue their learning after the camp, the following websites should be helpful:

### Arduino Website
View documentation on Arduinos and download the Arduino IDE software for free:

<https://www.arduino.cc>

### Online Vendors
These vendors sell quality parts and offer many instructions and tutorials for free:

<https://www.adafruit.com>

<http://www.dfrobot.com>

### Online Course/Content Providers
The following sites offer courses on a variety of subjects - computer science and much more. The course content and lectures are often offered for free, with the option to pay for the course and receive a certificate upon completion.

## Contents

### Lessons
This folder contains the self directed lesson modules and a few other reference materials for the camp. Modules contain short descriptions of concepts, short code samples, and challenge problems.

### Samples
This folder contains sample code and wiring diagrams for many components and some coding techniques.

### Project Ideas
This folder contains ideas that students may use for inspiration for their projects. These are meant to be primarily inspirational, and not strict requirement/design documents.

### Schedule
A rough outline of the schedule of the camp.

### Instructor Materials
Raw documents and instructor notes for the design, implementation, and improvement of the course. Not really very interesting to the learner.
