PREDATOR/PEST DETERRENT
==================

People who like to grow and raise things often have trouble with animals
harming their agricultural efforts. People who grow vegetables might have
birds or deer eat their plants. Chickens might be attacked by predators like
coyotes or bobcats. Raccoons are a general menace.

Create a device that can help scare off these nuisances. Motions, noises, or
lights that mimic larger predator eyes can all be deterrents. Your
deterrents are more likely to be effective if they activate in a reactionary
manner instead of always being on. Some deterrents won't make sense to use
if nothing is around, if it is the wrong time of day, and so forth. See if
your device can work to ward off multiple kinds of nuisances, perhaps one
kind during the day, another during the night.
