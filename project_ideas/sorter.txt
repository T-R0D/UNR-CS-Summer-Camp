SORTER
======

Write a program capable of sorting a set of numbers.

Sorting is actually kind of complicated, so if you can write a program that
can sort some numbers in an array, that will be impressive!

Use your Google Fu to lookup different sort algorithms. I recommend looking
closely at "Bubble Sort".

You can simply hard code some numbers in your program to start, and be sure to
print the numbers before and after sorting to them to validate your code.

If you are feeling spunky, try implementing multiple sorting algorithms,
sorting large lists of numbers, and even timing their performance for
comparison.
