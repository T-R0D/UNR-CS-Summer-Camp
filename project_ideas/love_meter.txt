LOVE METER
==========

Come and get your lo-o-o-ove!

Use some kind of sensor to "measure love" (like a temperature sensor), then
have a servo motor turn to point on some kind of dial how strong the love is.

You can vary your choice of sensor, and then just display the category the
reading is in. You don't necessarily have to use the sensor's reading, just
wait for a reading and then generate a random number. You could also combine
media, and use the servo motor for a physical dial/gauge and a screen to
print text.
