STRENGTH TESTER
===============

Just like the High Striker game (Google it) at the carnival!

Well, not quite... We can't really build anything people can hit with a hammer.
We can have people flick a vibration sensor with their fingers and light up
LEDs according to the strength of the flick.

Ideally, the game would do something like wait for someone to push a start
button; blink a count down; then wait for a flick whose strength is above a
certain (low) threshold, and light up LEDs according to the strength of the
hit; then start the cycle over again.

Some other features you might consider would be placing a time limit on how
long players can flick the sensor, having the buzzer pay a sound if players
flick hard enough, or creating a flashy light show for when the game is
waiting to be played.
