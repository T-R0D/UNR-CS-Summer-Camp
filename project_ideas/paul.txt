PAUL (A Simon knock-off)
========================

Create an Arduino version of the classic memory game!

Really think through and draw out the state machine on this one, it will help.
Use 3 or 4 LED colors and the same number of buttons. Have the game either
randomly produce patterns for the user, or hard-code your own (random is
probably better; hard-coding will make testing easier). Using arrays is
probably the cleanest way to write the code, but you could also declare
several distinct variables if you wanted.


Bonus: See if you can make things move faster as the game progresses, or make
the speed adjustable with a potentiometer.
