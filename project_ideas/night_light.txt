NIGHT LIGHT
===========

Create an interesting version of a night light!

The basic idea is to have a program that turns on lights (LEDs) based on the
light level in the room. But get creative! have more lights turn on when it
is darker, have lights turn on or off the longer your project is in a dark
room, etc.! Make the most creative night light you can!
