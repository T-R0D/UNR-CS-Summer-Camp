BONK-IT (Bop-it knock-off)
==========================

Flick it! Twist it! Tip it!

See if you can make a game that tells a player to complete one of three
actions, and see if they can do it in the given time limit. You might use
a piezo buzzer as a vibration sensor, an adjustable potentiometer as
something to twist, and the tilt sensor to detect when the game is tipped.
You could print text to tell the players what to do, or light LEDs to tell
them what they should be doing.

Bonus points if you can make the time allowed to do the action decrease as the
game advances!
