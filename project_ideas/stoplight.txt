=========

Construct a basic traffic control device!

Write a basic program that will manage traffic and prevent accidents! Start
with lights for 2 roads, then move to 4. Then see if you can make the
North/South lights work in sync with each other, and the East/West lights
work in sync with each other. Maybe see if you can make your system
interruptible by adding sensors to simulate cars pulling up to the light.
If you really want to do this project to death, add left-turn lights too!
