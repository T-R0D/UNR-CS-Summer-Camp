Good volunteers/helpers make things GREAT! (At least 2 or 3 if you can.)

Add lesson module for electricity/circuit basics.

Introduce the concept of state machines sooner. Perhaps do a very basic
version early on, then an advanced one where we deconstruct the diagram into
the code building blocks the other lesson modules discuss.

Use a morse code SOS example that carries through the course. It is easy to do
a rough version in the beginning with constants and lots of copy/pasted code.
Then improve it with loops. Finally, improve it through the use of functions.

Improve the challenge problems by making them more interesting. This can be
done by editing for clarity, adding more pop-culture references, and making
problems more relevant to problems the students will have.

Add more easter eggs - because they are fun.

Think about how to better engage younger campers - they seem to struggle
with anything harder than printing messages, but love the circuits even
though they don't understand those very well either.

Some campers won't ask for help and need to be directly engaged to help
motivate them to learn. Often sitting with them and coding an example with
them is enough to hook them.

The kids like to copy/paste a lot of crap from the internet. Not sure what to
do about that - at least they are engaged?

Having students make a full prototype product, including cardboard casings and
such, does take more work, but it is very pleasing to see.

Consider adding general requirements to the project, like "must use at least
one for loop" or "must use 2 of the 3 types of functions we learned about" to
help force use/solidification of topics covered in class.
